## 1.1 Overview of ANON

ANON is a comprehensive digital protection service that monitors, manages, and safeguards users’ online presence and personal data. Powered by advanced AI automation, ANON actively detects, flags, and removes sensitive information, providing immediate action beyond standard monitoring.

The platform scans both the surface web and dark web for impersonation, unauthorized sharing of private information, data leaks, compromised credentials, unapproved content, and even sophisticated threats like deepfakes. With customizable smart settings, users can choose precisely what they want removed, ensuring that only unwanted content is targeted while preserving what matters.

Real-time alerts and updates give users complete control and peace of mind, keeping their personal information secure and hidden across the internet.
