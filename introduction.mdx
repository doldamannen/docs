##  1.1 Overview of Searchwipe One

Searchwipe One is a comprehensive digital protection service that monitors, manages, and safeguards users' online presence and personal data. Powered by advanced AI automation, Searchwipe One actively detects, flags, and removes sensitive information, providing immediate action beyond standard monitoring. 

The platform scans both the surface web and dark web for impersonation, unauthorized sharing of private information, data leaks, compromised credentials, unapproved content, and even sophisticated threats like deepfakes.
