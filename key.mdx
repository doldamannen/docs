## 4.1 Automated Removal Requests

ANON's Automated Removal Requests feature streamlines the process of taking down unauthorized or sensitive content by automatically initiating removal requests on the user’s behalf. When the system detects data that violates the user’s privacy or has been shared without consent, it immediately contacts relevant platforms, webmasters, or search engines to request removal.

Using AI and predefined templates aligned with platform policies, ANON ensures that removal requests are accurate, efficient, and compliant, allowing users to protect their information without needing to handle these processes manually.

## 4.2 Face & Voice Recognition

ANON's Face & Voice Recognition feature allows users to safeguard their identity by tracking and flagging any online content that includes their facial image or voice. By utilizing advanced biometric recognition, the system compares user-provided facial and voice data with media across various platforms, identifying unauthorized use of their likeness or voice.

When matches are found, the system immediately triggers a removal request to protect the user’s identity, preventing misuse and ensuring their digital presence remains under control.

## 4.3 Surface & Dark Web Monitoring

ANON's Surface & Dark Web Monitoring continuously scans both the visible web and dark web for any unauthorized exposure of the user’s personal information. The system uses AI-driven search techniques to detect data such as credentials, payment information, and custom identifiers across various forums, marketplaces, and websites.

With real-time monitoring, ANON identifies potential threats early and initiates immediate actions to mitigate risks, ensuring that sensitive data stays protected, even in hidden parts of the internet.

## 4.4 AI-Powered Risk Assessment

ANON's AI-Powered Risk Assessment evaluates the exposure level of the user’s personal data and assigns a dynamic risk score based on detected threats. Using machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes patterns, data sources, and frequency of exposure to prioritize high-risk instances and focus protection efforts on the most critical areas.

This risk assessment not only informs users of their current security status but also enables proactive defenses by adjusting monitoring intensity and initiating rapid responses for elevated risks.

## 4.5 Reputation Score

ANON's Reputation Score provides users with a real-time metric of their online presence, reflecting how frequently and where their personal information appears across the internet. By analyzing mentions, exposures, and detected risks, the system assigns a score that helps users understand their visibility and potential vulnerabilities.

This score allows users to actively manage their digital footprint, take steps to reduce exposure, and maintain a strong online reputation by keeping personal data under control.
