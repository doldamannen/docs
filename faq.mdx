## On what do you base the valuation?

We have developed a tool that allows users to delete their personal information from various parts of the internet, addressing a significant and growing market need for online privacy. With an initial investment of 2 million SEK and an advertising spend of 1.9 million SEK, we have generated total revenue (realized and deferred) of 6.1 million SEK. Achieving an Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of 3.6 million SEK just seven months after receiving pre-seed capital demonstrates our strong growth trajectory.

Our rigorously stress-tested KPIs suggest that scaling our advertising budget will proportionally increase our revenue. Combined with our new and vastly superior tech we will introduce to the market, and access to a much larger market, we expect to exceed the same scale factor—for instance, surpassing an ARR of 36 million SEK with an investment of 20 million SEK.&#x20;

Realistically, we project reaching an ARR of over 85 million SEK in 24 months, with total revenue assets of 144 million SEK, assuming our Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) remains constant (though we anticipate it will increase with our improved product). Currently, the standard valuation for tech SaaS companies is a multiple of two years' projected revenue. Since we are not yet, we have applied a larger discount to this valuation method. The valuation does not account for the additional growth potential from new sales verticals unlocked by our enhanced and more versatile product, and the intrinsic value of the tech itself, further supporting the fairness of our valuation.

## How much it is going to cost you to run a GPU workload to do it and make sure the outcome is cash-flow positive?

A self hosted GPU approach, constantly monitoring leaks, information, images and video can be brought down to approximately 9 000 USD per month per 10 000 clients. Scanning the entire web 3 times a day per customer costs about 0.015 USD per customer per day. Or 0.45 USD per customer per month. So the monitoring software will be incredibly cheap to run.&#x20;

## Competition analysis: What are key differences between this product and companies like privacyhawk, Incogni and DeleteMe ?

Our product is fundamentally different from services like PrivacyHawk, DeleteMe, and Incogni. These companies merely focus on removing customer data from data brokers—entities that collect or purchase personal information (e.g., from apps or online services) and resell it, often to advertisers. While this practice can pose risks, such as exposure to bad actors who might buy or hack this data, it represents only one small aspect of online privacy. PrivacyHawk, DeleteMe, and Incogni operate by sending legal requests to data brokers, asking them to delete your personal information. In the U.S., data brokers are legally required to comply with these requests. However, these services do not address data on publishers, blogs, forums, news sites, search engine results, social media posts, fake profiles, impersonations or any place where you may have been doxed. These are often the more visible and dangerous forms of exposure online.

Additionally, data brokers do not display your personal data publicly, so their information typically does not appear in search engine results. As a result, removing your data from brokers does not reduce your online visibility or address immediate risks such as impersonation, identity theft, or public exposure. Unlike these services, we focus on removing your information from publicly visible sources that are easily accessed, misused, or exploited.

Another significant difference is that companies like Incogni often use strong and misleading language to suggest comprehensive protection. In reality, they only cover data resellers, which is one small part of the privacy landscape. Identity thieves and other malicious actors rarely rely on data broker information, so the protection these services provide is inherently limited. By contrast, our service offers a more holistic solution, focusing on the areas where real risks occur and where privacy matter.

Lastly, customers of data broker removal services don’t know which broker databases actually held their information to begin with. For example, you might pay for a subscription but never learn whether your data was removed from one database or forty. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess whether the service is worth renewing. In comparison, we provide clear reporting and visibility into what data we find and where we remove it, ensuring that you know exactly what you’re paying for and what has been achieved. While services like PrivacyHawk, DeleteMe, and Incogni offer a useful tool for opting out of data broker databases, they represent only a small and limited solution to online privacy. Our service offers a far more comprehensive approach to safeguarding your digital footprint by tackling both visible and non-visible threats across a broader spectrum of platforms.

## How is voice and facial data handled—stored or captured and discarded—and how is responsible AI usage ensured to address concerns about feeding personal data into the system?

We operate on the principle of data minimization, meaning we collect and store only the minimal information necessary to provide our service effectively. For voice and facial data, we do not store or retain any data unless it is flagged as relevant to our customers. All unflagged data is immediately discarded to ensure privacy and security. For the minimal customer data we do store, we use a HIPAA-compliant database that is maximally encrypted both at rest and during transfer, ensuring industry-leading safeguards for personal information.

Additionally, our use of AI is designed with responsibility and transparency in mind. We prioritize ethical practices, ensuring that personal data is used strictly within the scope of our customers’ requests and is never exploited or shared. This reinforces our commitment to safeguarding our users’ privacy while leveraging AI to deliver a highly secure and efficient service.
